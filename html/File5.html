	<b>SCENE II. A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep;
	a light burning.

	<b>Enter OTHELLO<br>

	OTHELLO</b><br>
	It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--<br>
	Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--<br>
	It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;<br>
	Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,<br>
	And smooth as monumental alabaster.<br>
	Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.<br>
	Put out the light, and then put out the light:<br>
	If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,<br>
	I can again thy former light restore,<br>
	Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,<br>
	Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,<br>
	I know not where is that Promethean heat<br>
	That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,<br>
	I cannot give it vital growth again.<br>
	It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.<br>
	Kissing her<br>
